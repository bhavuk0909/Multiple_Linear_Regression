# Multiple_Linear_Regression
Multiple Linear Regression attempts to model the Relationship between two or more features and a response by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The steps to perform multiple linear Regression are almost similar to that of simple linear Regression. The Difference Lies in the Evalution. We can use it to find out which factor has the highest impact on the predicted output and now different variable relate to each other.
